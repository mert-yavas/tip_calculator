## Challange #2
Tip Calculator

## Overview

Hello again! My name is Mert, and this is the second project in my "100 Days of Python" challenge. The Tip Calculator is a Python program that helps to calculate the amount each person should pay after a shared meal, including tip.

## How it Works

The script performs the following steps:
1. Asks the user for the total bill amount.
2. Inquires about the percentage of the tip they would like to add (10, 12, or 15%).
3. Asks how many people will split the bill.

The program then calculates the total payment per person, including the specified tip.

When you run this script, it will prompt you for the total bill, the tip percentage, and the number of people. After you provide this information, it calculates and displays the amount each person should pay.

Feel free to use this script next time you dine with friends or family to easily split the bill!
